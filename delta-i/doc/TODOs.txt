- please, write as short as possible TODO messages.  in principle this
  should be done quickly so one should not forget the context.

- please, use characters that can be read uniformly in any reader.
  avoid cedilha, til, tabs, etc.

- please, move finished activities to a DONE.txt file.  you can remove
  these guidelines or move to GUIDE.txt if you will.

- last but not least we should organize the directories better. i
  tried to locate the C code for the library and Java code I sent to
  you unsuccessfully.
