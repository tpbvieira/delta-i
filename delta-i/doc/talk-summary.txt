Mutation testing regained significant force recently as a technique to
assess the quality of a test suite.  One practical problem of mutation
testing is the high cost of the analysis.  The cost is proportional to
the product of the number of test cases and the number of mutants; the
later can grow quickly with the size of the application.  Despite the
significant advances in reducing this cost it is still very high.
Recent experimental data indicates that mutation analysis of large
applications can take hours even for test suites that run in seconds.

This talk will present the idea of using Delta Execution (DE) to
optimize Mutation Testing and the recent optimizations in our DE
implementation to enable this idea.  Conceptually, DE makes it
possible to execute a test on all mutants, simultaneously.  For that
it uses a special representation of state that explicitly encodes set
of individual states.  Each individual state corresponds to a distinct
mutant.
